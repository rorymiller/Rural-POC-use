# Introduction

Since the rise and fall of a cardiac biomarker became part of the definition of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 2012, testing troponin in the setting of chest pain has been an essential part of the risk assessment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[@thygesen2013] This should be true regardless of which part of the country a patient presents with chest pain in New Zealand (NZ), including in rural hospitals.

Troponin results should be available within an hour [**ref**]


A rural hospital in NZ is defined as "a hospital staffed by suitably trained and experienced generalists (both medical officers and rural general practitioners), who take full clinical responsibility for a wide range of clinical presentations. While residents specialists may also work in these hospitals, specialist cover is limited to 24 hr / 7 day cover in no more than one specialist area".[@lawrenson2016; @williamson2010] Patient presentations and case load are broad and many rural hospitals in New Zealand are managing acute myocardial infarctions, both uncomplicated and complicated, either initially or through out the entirety of the patients hospital stay.[@williamson2010] Many of these rural hospitals will be some distance, in many cases more than several hours from specialist services, including laboratories and cardiology.

A 2011 survey of hospitals in New Zealand, subsequently updated but unpublished in 2014,[@pickeringTroponinAssaysUse2014] showed there were many assays available and being used in New Zealand ranging from point-of-care assays through to laboratory based highly sensitive assays.[@latif2012] Neither of these surveys focused specifically on rural hospitals in New Zealand and did not include all rural hospitals in New Zealand, nor did they demonstrate the *context* of testing the troponin, i.e. time delay.

They did show however, that many rural hospitals were using point-of-care troponin. In another survey published in 2010, most rural hospitals had access to both laboratory and point-of-care troponin, but a significant number were having to wait more than 90 minutes for a result.


The aim of this survey is to gain a snapshot of the type and way troponin assays are used by NZ rural hospitals in 2018 in the assessment of chest pain.

There are many assays available in New Zealand (NZ) that range from qualatiative point-of-care assays to modern highly sensitive troponin assays.


This includes New Zealand (NZ) rural hospitals.
