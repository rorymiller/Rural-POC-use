# Methods

A cross-sectional survey was performed in March 2018. The survey was designed and distributed using the Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, USA) platform. The survey was sent to 27 clinical leaders of rural hospitals in New Zealand. Hospitals were followed up if required by email or phone.

Questions were asked about whether the rural hospital uses a point-of-care troponin assay, whether they are reliant on it 24-hours per day and what the cut-off was for a positive test. They were also asked about access to high-sensitivity troponin assays and how long a result took to return once it was drawn from the patient.

Information was also gathered regarding the use of accelerated chest pain pathways, and whether exercise tolerance testing was available onsite at the rural hospital.

Basic data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel.
