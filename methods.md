# Methods

A cross-sectional survey was performed. The survey was designed and carried out using the Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, USA) platform. The survey was sent to 27 clinical leaders of rural hospitals in New Zealand. Questions were asked about whether the rural hospital uses a point-of-care troponin assay, whether they are reliant on it 24-hours per day and what the cut-off was for a positive test. They were also asked about access to high-sensitivity troponin assays and how long a result took to return once it was drawn from the patient.

Basic data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel.
