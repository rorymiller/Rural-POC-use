# Results

Twenty-three rural hospitals responded to the survey request. Twenty-two filled this out completely.

Of the respondents, three represented Level one rural hospitals, seven level two and thirteen level three rural hospitals.

Sixteen (76%) rural hospitals used a point-of-care assay at some stage during the day. Thirteen (82%) of these were reliant on the point-of-care troponin 24-hours per day.

Two of the three level one rural hospitals are reliant on point-of-care troponin 24-hours per day. The other rural hospital has no access to troponin.

Six (86%) of the level two rural hospitals use point-of-care troponin with five of these hospitals reliant on this assay 24-hours per day.

Of the thirteen level 3 rural hospitals eight (62%) use point-of-care troponin and six are reliant 24-hours per day (46%). Seven have access to on-site high-sensitivity troponin. One rural hospital uses a high-sensitivity assay during the day and resorts to a point-of-care troponin overnight.

Thirteen (56%) rural hospitals indicated they had access to high-sensitivity troponin assays with eight (35%) had high sensitivity assay available on-site. In all cases laboratory staff were required to be called back in. A high-sensitivity result was available within 1 hour during working hours in nine rural hospitals, but this reduced to six hospitals after-hours.

Most hospitals that are using point-of-care troponin are using the Abbott i-Stat cTnI assay (10, 63%).
