# Results

Twenty-three rural hospitals responded to the survey request. Twenty-two filled this out completely.

Of the respondents, three represented Level one rural hospitals, seven level two and thirteen level three rural hospitals.

Sixteen (76%) rural hospitals used a point-of-care assay at some stage during the day. Thirteen (82%) of these were reliant on the point-of-care troponin 24-hours per day.

Two of the three level one rural hospitals are reliant on point-of-care troponin 24-hours per day. The other rural hospital has no access to troponin.

Six (86%) of the level two rural hospitals use point-of-care troponin with five of these hospitals reliant on this assay 24-hours per day.

Of the thirteen level 3 rural hospitals eight (62%) use point-of-care troponin and six are reliant 24-hours per day (46%). Seven have access to on-site high-sensitivity troponin. One rural hospital uses a high-sensitivity assay during the day and resorts to a point-of-care troponin overnight.

Most hospitals that are using point-of-care troponin are using the Abbott i-Stat cTnI assay (10, 63%). Three hospitals use the radiometer AQT-90 Flex assay.

Four (40%) rural hospitals using the Abbott I-stat cTnI were using the manufacturer's cut-off of 0.08 ug/L. The remaining hospitals were using a cut-off below the 99th centile (0.04 ug/L). All three hospitals using the Radiometer AQT-90 Flex use a cut-off lower (0.017) than that recommended by the manufacturer (0.03).

Thirteen (56%) rural hospitals indicated they had access to high-sensitivity troponin assays with eight (35%) had high sensitivity assay available on-site. In all cases laboratory staff were required to be called back in after hours to perform the test. A high-sensitivity result was available within 1 hour during working hours in nine rural hospitals, but this reduced to six hospitals after-hours.

Of hospitals that use point-of-care troponin 24-hours per day, nine (69%) did not use an accelerated chest pain pathway (combine ECG and objective risk assessment). three used EDACS-ADP and one used a combination of the HEART and TIMI scores.

Of hospitals that use high-sensitivity troponin assays, all eight used an ADP. EDACS-ADP was used by five, TIMI by one and EDACS and modified TIMI by another.

Six of the 23 rural hospitals had access to on-site exercise tolerance testing (treadmill). This was available Same or next day in three of these or within a week in one. This was available within a month in one rural hospital. All six rural hospitals were level three hospitals.
